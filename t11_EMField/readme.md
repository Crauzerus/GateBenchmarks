**Description:** Example of a 1 MeV proton beam inside an uniform electromagnetic field of  40 kV/m and 1.5 T in vacuum. The electromagnetic field is defined in data/emfield.txt. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the basic functionality of the command:

```
/gate/geometry/setElectMagTabulateField3D
```

which can be used to apply custom uniform or non-uniform electromagnetic fields in GATE. The post-processing script plots the beam deflection curve based on Gaussian fits of the 2D dose distribution scored at 0.1 mm distances.
